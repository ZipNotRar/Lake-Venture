# Lake-Venture
## The files presented here show the logic behind production of the Virtual Reality Underwater Diving Experience "Lake-Venture":-

* The [**MirrorCopy.cs script**](MirrorCopy.cs) gives the patient an illusion that their limbless arm is presented in-game thereby mirroring the movement of the arm with which they are experiencing the atmosphere.
* The [**Spawnning.cs script**](Spawnning.cs) initiates random artifacts and aquatic animals within the game with a given interval of time.
* Finally, the [**SwimMovement.cs script**](SwimMovement.cs) lets the patient "swim" when they are underwater within the game.
* Finally, the [**audioScript.cs script**](audioScript.cs) is responsible for providing the background music when being underwater.
* Finally, the [**mirrorHand.cs script**](mirrorHand.cs) is responsible for mirroring the position and rotation of the patient's controller "hand" in the game.
* Finally, the [**swimmer.cs script**](swimmer.cs) is responsible for creating an underwater fog effect at the very moment of patient going underwater.

### Additionally, this clip will give you a structured explaination on how these scripts create gameplay mechanics.
